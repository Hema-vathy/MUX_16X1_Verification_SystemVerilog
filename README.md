# MUX_16X1_Verification_SystemVerilog
This project verifies a parameterized 16x1 Mux using SystemVerilog with configurable parameters: WIDTH=32, DEPTH=16, and SELECT_LINE_DEPTH=4. The verification ensures correct output selection for all input combinations, validating flexibility, accuracy, and reliability of the multiplexer design.
